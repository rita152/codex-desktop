# Docs (docs/)

## Overview

Project documentation and AI engineering assets.

## Structure

- `ai/`: AI engineering assets (project facts, changelog, migration plans)
  - `PROJECT_SNAPSHOT.md`: current project state
  - `TODO_NOW.md`: active tasks
  - `CHANGELOG_DEV.md`: development changelog
  - `INDEX.md`: asset index
  - `MIGRATION_PLAN.md`: architecture migration plans

## Conventions

For any new feature docs:
- Title should clearly state it describes the **current implementation**
- Include: prerequisites, workflow steps, troubleshooting, implementation pointers
